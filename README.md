# Weather Application

This project is a **Weather Application** developed to practice **Tkinter**, **Python**, and working with APIs. The app provides weather information for the current day and up to four days in the future.

## Features

### Core Features:
- **Weather Information for Today**:
  - Fetches current weather conditions using an API.
  - Displays weather status and an icon corresponding to the condition (e.g., sunny, cloudy).
- **Future Weather Forecast**:
  - Provides weather data for the next four days.
  - Includes weather condition summaries and relevant icons.
- **Dynamic UI Updates**:
  - Refreshes the weather information dynamically when new data is fetched.
- **Error Handling**:
  - Handles cases of failed API requests or invalid responses.
  - Displays error messages using Tkinter's message box.

### UI Details:
- Built with **Tkinter** for a graphical user interface.
- Uses **Pillow (PIL)** to manage weather icons dynamically.
- Organized layout with tabs for current and future forecasts.

## Technology Stack
- **Python**: Core programming language.
- **Tkinter**: For creating the GUI.
- **Pillow**: For working with images/icons.
- **Requests**: For making HTTP API calls.

## Data Sources
- Weather data is fetched using APIs from a weather service provider.

## Error Handling and Validation
- Validates API responses.
- Ensures the application doesn't crash on invalid data.

## Personal Outcomes
- Improved understanding of **Tkinter** for GUI development.
- Learned how to integrate APIs in Python applications.
- Enhanced debugging and error-handling skills.
